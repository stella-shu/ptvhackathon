# ðŸš‡ Fare Guard â€“ Inspector Ops Console (Catalyst 2025 Hackathon)

## Overview
Fare Guard is a full-stack web application designed to modernize fare 
inspection workflows for public transport.  
Inspectors can log patrols, drop pins, report incidents, and review shift 
summaries â€” all in real time or offline.  
The system improves efficiency, accountability, and transparency by 
replacing outdated pen-and-paper processes with a modern, interactive 
platform.
